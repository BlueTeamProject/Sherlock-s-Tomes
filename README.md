There is a mini-challenge available called 'Sherlock's Tomes' to walk you through the various forensic techniques that we discuss in our video.


Challenge:

While you--Sherlock, were out on a solo case, Watson got bored and decided to play a video game on your computer. When he tried to download it, he noticed he had to free up some space. Watson located 6 files and decided that they seemed rather unimportant. He didn’t want Sherlock to find out, so he used an erasing program to delete one. After noticing how long that would take, he decided to just press the delete key on the remaining 5. He was then able to download the video game, which didn’t seem to work at all! Defeated, Watson put the computer back to sleep, and snuck out of your study.

When you got home, your computer was missing some important ‘tomes’ you need, as well as the fact that your system may be compromised!

“The game is afoot…” you whisper to yourself as you begin forensic analysis of what’s happened…
